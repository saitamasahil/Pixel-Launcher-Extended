### Compatibility
This module is expected to work on ROMs which are based on fairly unmodified Android source code.
- Android 13 AOSP-based ROMs
- Android 13 QPR AOSP-based ROMs
- Android 13 QPR2 AOSP-based ROMs
> Ensure your ROM is equipped with the necessary GApps, including Google apps and services. Without them, certain features may not function optimally on vanilla ROM. Make sure to flash proper GApps Package for your rom if you are using vanilla rom.

### Implement In Custom ROMs
If you wanna implement Pixel Launcher Extended in your custom rom then [visit here](https://github.com/StudioKeys/vendor_PixelLauncherExtended).

### Prerequisites
- Compatible ROMs (**AOSP-based custom ROMs** or **Google Pixel stock ROM**) based on Android 13.
- Device rooted by [Magisk latest stable](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases/latest).
> It is strongly advised to only use the official version of Magisk, as there have been reports from users of various issues such as bootloops and other problems when using unofficial forks of the software. Therefore, it is highly recommended that users only download and install Magisk from the official source to ensure the stability of Pixel Launcher Extended.
- [LSPosed](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed) *(optional, if you want to use double tap to sleep feature)*

**Disclaimer**
- We **WON'T** be responsible if anything happens with your device. Bootloops are not expected, but you should always be prepared for the worst!

### Installation
- Uninstall any other launcher if you're using one. Only keep the default launcher
- Download the module installation file from [Download Links](#download-links) available
- Flash the file in Magisk and select your desired modifications using volume keys
- Reboot your device and go to **Settings** > **Apps** > **Default apps** > **Home app** and make sure **Pixel Launcher Extended** is selected

#### Variants
**Offline Installer**  
It doesn't require internet while flashing, but it's 100+ MB in size. It's available for download from [Download Links](#download-links) below. You can build it yourself too by following instructions from [Building from source](#building-from-source) section.

**Online Installer**  
It requires internet while flashing and downloads only selected files by user during installation. It's less than 5 MB in size. Depending upon your internet this variant may take more time in flashing compared to offline installer. It's available for download from [Download Links](#download-links) below. You can build it yourself too by following instructions from [Building from source](#building-from-source) section.

**Customize Installer**  
It's like offline installer but less in size. Installer zip size depends upon the modifications a user chooses while making the zip. It's not available for download from download links below. However, You can build it yourself by following instructions from [Building from source](#building-from-source) section. This variant is good for those whose phone's volume keys are broken or if they don't want to follow long instructions involving volume key presses(multiple times) while flashing in Magisk.

### Activating Double Tap to Sleep
- Make sure you installed DT2S while flashing the module(or selected it while making in case of customize installer)
- After rebooting device, open LSPosed and enable **Pixel Launcher DT2S**
- Force-stop Pixel Launcher Extended from Settings (or reboot device again)
- Double-tap once on home screen. Grant superuser permissions and enjoy

### Activating Developer Options In Launcher
- Make sure you enabled developer options while flashing the launcher(or selected it while making in case of customize installer)
- Now go to phone's setting>About phone>Build number & tap it 7-8 times. This will enable launcher's developer options along with rom's developer option.
> Using PLE with developer options enabled may expose root in some banking apps in some custom roms. If you face this issue then don't enable developer options while flashing/building launcher.

If your rom can't enable developer options even after enabling from module then tell ur rom maintainer to [use this commit](https://github.com/PixysOS/frameworks_base/commit/3ce7e0f5bffd90b0ec0cb6be44c01f5a73f70c13).

## Building from source

If you don't want to download built module from mirrors above, then you can build magisk module yourself.

### For Windows
- PowerShell 5+ required.
- Clone the repository with [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) or using [Git app](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
```bat
:: ONLY RUN THIS IF YOU USE GIT AND HAVE IT INSTALLED
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/saitamasahil/Pixel-Launcher-Extended
```
- Go to the directory where you cloned & hold `Shift` key & right click.
- Now click `Open PowerShell window here`
- Copy & paste this command
```bat
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./autobuild.ps1
```
- Select desired installer to make magisk module from PLE Builder
- Don't use git in command-line or powershell to clone repo. Some users reported that it's corrupting contents.
> PLE Builder for Windows doesn't support making of Customize Installer yet. Use Linux or Termux to make Customize Installer.

### For Ubuntu, Debian, and other Linux distributions
- The required zip package install command is in the script itself. However, if you encounter any errors, you can install **zip** manually. On Ubuntu or Debian, Use the following command to do so."
```sh
sudo apt install zip
```
- Now clone the repo using git.
```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/saitamasahil/Pixel-Launcher-Extended
```
- Navigate to the **Pixel-Launcher-Extended** folder.
```sh
cd Pixel-Launcher-Extended
```
- Run autobuild.sh.
```sh
bash autobuild.sh
```
- Choose `Offline Installer`, `Online Installer` or `Customize Installer` using number keys from PLE Builder.
- If you wanna make the module again & this time **Different Installer Magisk Module zip** then run autobuild.sh again.
```sh
bash autobuild.sh
```
- Use below command to update repo if you have already cloned it before.
```sh
git pull
```

### For Termux
- Open Termux, copy & paste this command:
```sh
termux-setup-storage
```
and give Termux storage access. If you get this warning "It appears that directory '~/storage' already exists. This script is going to rebuild its structure from scratch, wiping all dangling files. The actual storage content is not going to be deleted" then just do press "y". It won't do any harm to your device.
- Now copy & paste this command:
```sh
pkg upgrade || true
pkg install -y git
rm -rf Pixel-Launcher-Extended
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/saitamasahil/Pixel-Launcher-Extended
cd Pixel-Launcher-Extended
bash autobuild.sh
mv Pixel\ Launcher\ Extended* /sdcard
echo "Your magisk module is available in Internal Storage"
```
- Please make sure to grant storage permissions, if Termux asks you to do so, you will get Magisk module in your internal storage.
- Choose `Offline Installer`, `Online Installer` or `Customize Installer` using number keys from PLE Builder.
- Use [Termux From F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) to perform these tasks.
- The required zip package install command is in the script itself. However, if you encounter any errors, you can install **zip** manually. Use the following command to do so."
```sh
pkg install zip
```
- If you wanna make the module again & this time **Different Installer Magisk Module zip** then close Termux. Open new session and copy & paste the following command:
```sh
cd Pixel-Launcher-Extended
git pull
bash autobuild.sh
mv Pixel\ Launcher\ Extended* /sdcard
echo "Your magisk module is available in Internal Storage"
```

## Troubleshooting
If you face any issues while using Pixel Launcher Extended then look into this section first before asking in support group on Telegram.

### Weather widget in At A Glance or Select feature in recent tabs not working
Try updating Google App, Google Play Services, Android System Intelligence (ASI), Android System Webview, Google Calendar, Google Lens and all other Google apps from Play Store. We suggest you to use ROMs that have stock Pixel GApps by default.
After trying above solution if it still doesn't work or if you are facing random crashes in launcher then download [At A Glance Enhancer add-on](#at-a-glance-enhancer). It contains Android System Intelligence (which may fix all these issues).

### Material You isn't working properly, it's not changing color according to wallpaper
Your ROM may have its own implementation of Material You and that may be interfering with Pixel Launcher Extended. Although we have implemented fix for this within launcher, It is possible that you may still face this issue.

To fix this issue, please follow these steps:
- [Download Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/)
- Open it and type the command given below and press enter
```sh
su -c settings delete secure theme_customization_overlay_packages
``` 
- Grant superuser permissions
- Don't reboot as after reboot you will have to apply these changes again(blame your rom)

### Enabled “Hide Clock” from the Pixel Launcher Mods app and now the clock isn't returning
[Watch this video](https://index.teamfiles.workers.dev/0:/clock%20fix.mp4) for instructions to fix this issue.

### Pixel Launcher Mods stuck at loading screen or showing error
Force-stop the app and relaunch.

### Pixel Launcher Extended crashes while going to recent tab
Turn off **Overview suggestions** from Pixel Launcher Extended's settings.

### Quick Search Bar not opening
Make sure your rom has proper GApps. Also if your rom doesn't have Google App then download it from play store.

### Pixel Launcher Extended not showing in default home settings or no launcher showing after flashing PLE
Uninstall updates of the Pixel Launcher app and reboot your device. Make sure PLE isn't in magisk's deny list.
